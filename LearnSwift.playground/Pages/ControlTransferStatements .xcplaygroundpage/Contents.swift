// statements that change the order in which your code is execcuted
// break
// continue
// throw
// return
// fallthrough
// lable
// guard

// Continue :: used within the loops to stop execution of current loop increment and conitnue with next loop
// remember the continue statements has to be inside braces
for i in 1...10 {
    if( i % 2 == 0  ) {

//: break
// when used inside loop move control to line immediatels out side of the loop
// generally used in switch cases empty switch case not allowed in swift

//: Fall through 
// code below the case will be executed WITHOUT the case being matched
// NOTE :
// The fallthrough keyword does not check the case conditions for the switch case that it causes execution to fall into. The fallthrough keyword simply causes code execution to move directly to  the statements inside the next case (or default case) block, as in Câ€™s standard switch statement behavior.
